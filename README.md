Morse Code to English Text Converter and vise versa

The project consists of two parts one is "Decoder" that decodes English text to Morse code and the other one is "Encoder" to for the conversion of Morse code to English text.
Their logics are explained as below,

  1. Decoder:<br/>
     Break down of coded sentences into words.<br/>
     Breakdown of each coded word into letters<br/>
     Each Letter of a single word is decoded one at a time.<br/>
     After one word is decoded completed, it goes for the next word until all of the Morse code is decoded.<br/>
     
  2. Encoder:<br/>
     Input Text is converted to upper case.<br/>
     Break down of sentence into words.<br/>
     Breakdown of each word in to letters.<br/>
     Each Letter of a single word is coded one at a time.<br/>
     After one whole word is coded completed, it goes for the next word until all of the English Text is being converted.<br/>
